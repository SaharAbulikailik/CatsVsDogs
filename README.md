#Project Title
The project is titled "Neural Network Model for Image Classification."

##Description
The code provided is a Python program that trains and tests a neural network model for image classification using the MNIST dataset. The program uses Keras, a high-level neural networks API, >

The program first prepares the data by loading the training and testing data from pickle files, reshaping the data, and normalizing it. Then, the program creates a neural network model with m>

The program trains the model using the training data, and then tests the model using the testing data. The program outputs the accuracy and loss of the model during training and testing, and >

##Installation
To use the code, you will need to install Python and several Python libraries, including Keras, TensorFlow, NumPy, Matplotlib, and scikit-learn. You can install these libraries using pip, the>

##Usage
Download the code files.
Open the Python file in a Python IDE or text editor.
Run the program.
The program will train and test the neural network model and output the accuracy, loss, and confusion matrix for the test data. You can adjust the hyperparameters of the model, such as the nu>

##Credits
The program was written by Sahar Abulikailik and is based on the Keras library.
The data preparation code was from (balajisrinivas)
